        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all started in 2024 in Mumbai. We, Rishabh Panesar & Akshay Saini, shared a passion for both technology and tantalizing meals. Observing the hustle of daily life in Mumbai, we realized there was a gap – a need for a platform that not only connects food enthusiasts to a wide array of culinary delights but does so with efficiency, reliability, and a touch of personal care.</p>
